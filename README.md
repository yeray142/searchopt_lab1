# Lab 1 - Uninformed Search for Sokoban Puzzle

This project was completed as part of the **Search and Optimization** course at Chung-Ang University during the 1st semester of 2023.

## Project Description

The project involved designing an algorithm to solve the **Sokoban** puzzle. The algorithm uses **Uniform Cost Search** to efficiently explore the search space and find the optimal path to the goal state. The `search` function in the `Assignment1` class contains the implementation of the algorithm.

## Running the Code

To run the code, you need to have **Python 3** and the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `gym-sokoban`

You can install the libraries using the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After installing the libraries, you can run the code using the following command:

```
python main.py
```
